      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At the heart of our work is a simple truth: Hawai‘i was never legally given away — and its people never surrendered their right to live free, self-determined lives on their ancestral land.

We are here to educate, uplift, and unite. Our mission is to share the true history of the Hawaiian Kingdom — from its diplomatic recognition by world powers to its illegal overthrow and annexation by the United States. We invite all visitors, whether Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) or global ally, to engage with this living history and help chart a righteous path forward.

Grounded in aloha ʻāina (love for the land), cultural resilience, and international law, we stand for the restoration of Hawaiian independence through education, dialogue, and peaceful nation-building. We believe in the strength of the people — and that when truth is known, justice becomes inevitable.

This is a movement built on mana, not anger. On truth, not politics. On aloha, not division.

Join us in reclaiming our future, restoring our nation, and renewing the spirit of Hawai‘i for generations to come..</p>
