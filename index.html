      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>KHPA exists to honor, protect, and restore the sacred lands of Hawaiʻi and the dignity of her people through divine guidance, ʻohana unity, and cultural protocol.</p>

      Our mission is to educate and empower both Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) and newcomers with the true story and enduring spirit of the Hawaiian nation. We are a people-powered movement rooted in resilience, dedicated to reclaiming Hawai‘i’s sovereignty and restoring our kingdom as a thriving, independent nation. In doing so, we harness our collective energy and aloha (love) to build a future where Hawai‘i’s people determine their own destiny.

For over a century, Hawai‘i’s true status has been suppressed. The Hawaiian Kingdom was an internationally recognized sovereign nation until it was overthrown by a U.S.-backed coup in 1893 ￼. This was followed by a purported annexation in 1898 with no treaty or Hawaiian consent ￼, and a flawed 1959 referendum (with no independence option) that “manufactured” an appearance of consent ￼. Relying on that illegitimate vote, the United Nations passed Resolution 1469 in 1959, falsely affirming Hawai‘i’s integration into the US without a proper decolonization process ￼. Yet no illegal act could erase our identity or rights — even the U.S. Apology Resolution of 1993 acknowledged that Native Hawaiians never relinquished their sovereignty or national lands ￼.

Today, we carry forward a multi-generational movement for self-determination, grounded in knowledge, culture, and aloha ʻāina (love for our land). Through community education, legal and historical awareness, and cultural revitalization, we empower Hawaiians and allies to stand together with strength and dignity. By sharing our history and fostering unity, we transform pain into purpose – turning our shared resilience into a collective force for a just and liberated Hawai‘i.

Join Us: We welcome all who seek justice and truth — whether you are Kānaka reconnecting with your heritage or a supporter just learning the truth — to join this journey of hope and restoration. Guided by our ancestors’ wisdom and the principle “Ua mau ke ea o ka ʻāina i ka pono” (the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness), we dedicate ourselves to a Hawai‘i reborn in righteousness, freedom, and self-governance.
